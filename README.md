# NextJs Todo List App

## Overview

This is a simple Todo List application built using React (ReactJS/NextJS). The app allows users to manage tasks by adding, editing, marking as completed, and deleting them. Tasks have priorities (low, medium, high), and the UI is designed for a clean and user-friendly experience.

## Features

- Display a list of tasks with their respective status (completed or not).
- Add a new task.
- Edit an existing task.
- Mark a task as completed.
- Delete a task.
- Stylish and responsive user interface.
- Task counters for total and completed tasks.

## Bonus Features

- Local storage implementation for persistent tasks.
- Basic filtering system based on task priority.

## Technical Considerations

- Functional components and React hooks (e.g., useState, useEffect) for state management.
- Responsive design for optimal user experience.
